statement: All my adult life Iâ€™ve been finding creative solutions for visual and technological problems. I have a solid background of art fundamentals and roughly twenty years of experience in multimedia development. This makes me uniquely comfortable designing for both screen and print. Currently, my focus is trained on creating great user experiences via well-constructed user interfaces for web-based deliverables, supported by my strong brand identity skills. Ultimately, my passion is in advocating for the user and my talents are best utilized when allowed to problem-solve through that prism.
